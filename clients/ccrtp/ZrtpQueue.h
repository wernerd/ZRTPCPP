/**
 * GNU ccRTP extension to support GNU ZRTP.
 *
 * ZRTP was developed by Phil Zimmermann and provides functions to
 * negotiate keys and other necessary data (crypto data) to set-up
 * the Secure RTP (SRTP) crypto context. Refer to Phil's ZRTP
 * specification at his <a href="http://zfoneproject.com/">Zfone
 * project</a> site to get more detailed imformation about the
 * capabilities of ZRTP.
 *
 * <b>Short overview of the ZRTP implementation</b>
 *
 * ZRTP is a specific protocol to negotiate encryption algorithms
 * and the required key material. ZRTP uses a RTP session to
 * exchange its protocol messages.
 *
 * A complete GNU ZRTP implementation consists of two parts, the
 * GNU ZRTP core and specific code that binds the GNU ZRTP core to
 * the underlying RTP/SRTP stack and the operating system:
 * <ul>
 * <li>
 *      The GNU ZRTP core is independent of a specific RTP/SRTP
 *      stack and the operationg system and consists of the ZRTP
 *      protocol state engine, the ZRTP protocol messages, and the
 *      GNU ZRTP engine. The GNU ZRTP engine provides methods to
 *      setup ZRTP message and to analyze received ZRTP messages,
 *      to compute the crypto data required for SRTP, and to
 *      maintain the required hashes and HMAC.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 *      The second part of an implementation is specific
 *      <em>glue</em> code the binds the GNU ZRTP core to the
 *      actual RTP/SRTP implementation and other operating system
 *      specific services  such as timers.
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The GNU ZRTP core uses a callback interface class (refer to
 * ZrtpCallback) to access RTP/SRTP or operating specific methods,
 * for example to send data via the RTP/SRTP stack, to access
 * timers, provide mutex handling, and to report events to the
 * application.
 *
 * <b>The ZrtpQueue</b>
 *
 * ZrtpQueue implements code that is specific to the GNU ccRTP
 * implementation. ZrtpQueue also implements the specific code to
 * provide the mutex and timeout handling to the GNU ZRTP
 * core. Both, the mutex and the timeout handling, use the GNU
 * Common C++ library to stay independent of the operating
 * seystem. For more information refer to the <a
 * href="http://www.gnutelephony.org/index.php/GNU_Common_C%2B%2B">GNU
 * Common C++</a> web site.
 *
 * To perform its tasks ZrtpQueue
 * <ul>
 * <li> extends GNU ccRTP classes to use the underlying
 *      ccRTP methods and the RTP/SRTP send and receive queues
 * </li>
 * <li> implements the ZrtpCallback interface to provide ccRTP
 *      access and other specific services (timer, mutex) to GNU
 *      ZRTP
 * </li>
 * <li> provides ZRTP specific methods that applications may use
 *      to control and setup GNU ZRTP
 * </li>
 * <li> can register and use an application specific callback
 *      class (refer to ZrtpUserCallback)
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * After instantiating a GNU ZRTP session (see below for a short
 * example) applications may use the ZRTP specific methods of
 * ZrtpQueue to control and setup GNU ZRTP, for example enable or
 * disable ZRTP processing or getting ZRTP status information.
 *
 * GNU ZRTP provides a ZrtpUserCallback class that an application
 * may extend and register with ZrtpQueue. GNU ZRTP and ZrtpQueue
 * use the ZrtpUserCallback methods to report ZRTP events to the
 * application. The application may display this information to
 * the user or act otherwise.
 *
 * The following figure depicts the relationships between
 * ZrtpQueue, ccRTP RTP/SRTP implementation, the GNU ZRTP core,
 * and an application that provides an ZrtpUserCallback class.

 *
 * Because ZrtpQueue extends the ccRTP RTP/SRTP implementation
 * (AVPQueue) all public methods defined by ccRTP are also
 * available for a ZRTP session. ZrtpQueue overwrites some of the
 * public methods of ccRTP (AVPQueue) to implement ZRTP specific
 * code.
 *
 * GNU ZRTP provides a <em>SymmetricZRTPSession</em> type to
 * simplify its use. An application uses this type in the same way
 * as it would use the normal ccRTP <em>SymmetricRTPSession</em>
 * type. The following short code snippets show how an application
 * could instantiate ccRTP and GNU ZRTP sessions. The first
 * snippet shows how to instantiate a ccRTP session:
 *
 * @code
 * ...
 * #include <ccrtp/rtp.h>
 * ...
 *     SymmetricRTPSession tx(pattern.getSsrc(),
 *                            InetHostAddress("localhost"));
 * ...
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The same code as above but using a GNU ZRTP session this time:
 * @code
 * ...
 * #include <libzrtpcpp/zrtpccrtp.h>
 * ...
 *     SymmetricZRTPSession tx(pattern.getSsrc(),
 *                             InetHostAddress("localhost"));
 * ...
 *
 * @endcode
 *
 * The only differences are the different include statements and
 * the different session types.
 *
 * The <em>demo</em> folder contains a small example that shows
 * how to use GNU ZRTP.
 *
 * Please refer to the GNU ccRTP documentation for a description
 * of ccRTP methods and functions. This ZrtpQueue documentation
 * shows the ZRTP specific extensions and describes overloaded
 * methods and a possible different behaviour.

     * Initialize the ZrtpQueue.
     *
     * Before an application can use ZRTP it has to initialize the
     * ZRTP implementation. This method initializes the timeout
     * thread and opens a file that contains ZRTP specific
     * information such as the applications ZID (ZRTP id) and its
     * retained shared secrets.
     *
     * If one application requires several ZRTP sessions all
     * sessions use the same timeout thread and use the same ZID
     * file. Therefore an application does not need to do any
     * synchronisation regading ZID files or timeouts. This is
     * managed by the ZRTP implementation.
     *
     * The current implementation of ZrtpQueue does not support
     * different ZID files for one application instance. This
     * restriction may be removed in later versions.
     *
