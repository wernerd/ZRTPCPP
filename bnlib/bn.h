/*
 * bn.h - the interface to the bignum routines.
 * All functions which return ints can potentially allocate memory
 * and return -1 if they are unable to. All "const" arguments
 * are unmodified.
 *
 * This is not particularly asymmetric, as some operations are of the
 * form a = b @ c, while others do a @= b.  In general, outputs may not
 * point to the same struct BigNums as inputs, except as specified
 * below.  This relationship is referred to as "being the same as".
 * This is not numerical equivalence.
 *
 * The "Q" operations take "unsigned" inputs.  Higher values of the
 * extra input may work on some implementations, but 65535 is the
 * highest portable value.  Just because UNSIGNED_MAX is larger than
 * that, or you know that the word size of the library is larger than that,
 * that, does *not* mean it's allowed.
