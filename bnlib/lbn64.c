/*
 * lbn64.c - Low-level bignum routines, 64-bit version.
 *
 * Copyright (c) 1995  Colin Plumb.  All rights reserved.
 * For licensing and other legal details, see the file legal.c.
 *
 * NOTE: the magic constants "64" and "128" appear in many places in this
 * file, including inside identifiers.  Because it is not possible to
 * ask "#ifdef" of a macro expansion, it is not possible to use the
 * preprocessor to conditionalize these properly.  Thus, this file is
 * intended to be edited with textual search and replace to produce
 * alternate word size versions.  Any reference to the number of bits
 * in a word must be the string "64", and that string must not appear
 * otherwise.  Any reference to twice this number must appear as "128",
 * which likewise must not appear otherwise.  Is that clear?
 *
 * Remember, when doubling the bit size replace the larger number (128)
 * first, then the smaller (64).  When halving the bit size, do the
 * opposite.  Otherwise, things will get wierd.  Also, be sure to replace
 * every instance that appears.  (:%s/foo/bar/g in vi)
 *
 * These routines work with a pointer to the least-significant end of
 * an array of WORD64s.  The BIG(x), LITTLE(y) and BIGLTTLE(x,y) macros
 * defined in lbn.h (which expand to x on a big-edian machine and y on a
 * little-endian machine) are used to conditionalize the code to work
 * either way.  If you have no assembly primitives, it doesn't matter.
 * Note that on a big-endian machine, the least-significant-end pointer
 * is ONE PAST THE END.  The bytes are ptr[-1] through ptr[-len].
 * On little-endian, they are ptr[0] through ptr[len-1].  This makes
 * perfect sense if you consider pointers to point *between* bytes rather
 * than at them.
 *
 * Because the array index values are unsigned integers, ptr[-i]
 * may not work properly, since the index -i is evaluated as an unsigned,
 * and if pointers are wider, zero-extension will produce a positive
 * number rahter than the needed negative.  The expression used in this
 * code, *(ptr-i) will, however, work.  (The array syntax is equivalent
 * to *(ptr+-i), which is a pretty subtle difference.)
 *
 * Many of these routines will get very unhappy if fed zero-length inputs.
 * They use assert() to enforce this.  An higher layer of code must make
 * sure that these aren't called with zero-length inputs.
 *
 * Any of these routines can be replaced with more efficient versions
 * elsewhere, by just #defining their names.  If one of the names
 * is #defined, the C code is not compiled in and no declaration is
 * made.  Use the BNINCLUDE file to do that.  Typically, you compile
 * asm subroutines with the same name and just, e.g.
 * #define lbnMulAdd1_64 lbnMulAdd1_64
 *
 * If you want to write asm routines, start with lbnMulAdd1_64().
 * This is the workhorse of modular exponentiation.  lbnMulN1_64() is
 * also used a fair bit, although not as much and it's defined in terms
 * of lbnMulAdd1_64 if that has a custom version.  lbnMulSub1_64 and
 * lbnDiv21_64 are used in the usual division and remainder finding.
 * (Not the Montgomery reduction used in modular exponentiation, though.)
 * Once you have lbnMulAdd1_64 defined, writing the other two should
 * be pretty easy.  (Just make sure you get the sign of the subtraction
 * in lbnMulSub1_64 right - it's dest = dest - source * k.)
 *
 * The only definitions that absolutely need a double-word (BNWORD128)
 * type are lbnMulAdd1_64 and lbnMulSub1_64; if those are provided,
 * the rest follows.  lbnDiv21_64, however, is a lot slower unless you
 * have them, and lbnModQ_64 takes after it.  That one is used quite a
 * bit for prime sieving.

 *

 *                -----------
 *                  rrrr rrrr
 *
 * The implicit 3/2-digit d*qh and d*ql subtractors are computed this way:
 *   First, estimate a q digit so that nh/dh works.  Subtracting qh*dh from
 *   the (nh.h nh.l) list leaves a 1/2-word remainder r.  Then compute the
 *   low part of the subtractor, qh * dl.   This also needs to be subtracted
 *   from (nh.h nh.l nl.h) to get the final remainder.  So we take the
 *   remainder, which is (nh.h nh.l) - qh*dl, shift it and add in nl.h, and
 *   try to subtract qh * dl from that.  Since the remainder is 1/2-word
 *   long, shifting and adding nl.h results in a single word r.
 *   It is possible that the remainder we're working with, r, is less than
 *   the product qh * dl, if we estimated qh too high.  The estimation
 *   technique can produce a qh that is too large (never too small), leading
 *   to r which is too small.  In that case, decrement the digit qh, add
 *   shifted dh to r (to correct for that error), and subtract dl from the
 *   product we're comparing r with.  That's the "correct" way to do it, but
 *   just adding dl to r instead of subtracting it from the product is
 *   equivalent and a lot simpler.  You just have to watch out for overflow.
 *
 *   The process is repeated with (rrrr rrrr nl.l) for the low digit of the
 *   quotient ql.
 *
 * The various uses of 64/2 for shifts are because of the note about
 * automatic editing of this file at the very top of the file.

 *
 * This uses algorithm D from Knuth (4.3.1), except that we do binary

 *
 * This function is used for some modular reduction, but it is not used in
 * the modular exponentiation loops; they use Montgomery form and the
 * corresponding, more efficient, Montgomery reduction.  This code
 * is needed for the conversion to Montgomery form, however, so it
 * has to be here and it might as well be reasonably efficient.
 *
 * The overall operation is as follows ("top" and "up" refer to the
 * most significant end of the number; "bottom" and "down", the least):
 *
 * - Shift the divisor up until the most significant bit is set.
 * - Shift the dividend up the same amount.  This will produce the
 *   correct quotient, and the remainder can be recovered by shifting
 *   it back down the same number of bits.  This may produce an overflow
 *   word, but the word is always strictly less than the most significant
 *   divisor word.
 * - Estimate the first quotient digit qhat:
 *   - First take the top two words (one of which is the overflow) of the
 *     dividend and divide by the top word of the divisor:
 *     qhat = (nh,nm)/dh.  This qhat is >= the correct quotient digit
 *     and, since dh is normalized, it is at most two over.
 *   - Second, correct by comparing the top three words.  If
 *     (dh,dl) * qhat > (nh,nm,ml), decrease qhat and try again.
 *     The second iteration can be simpler because there can't be a third.
 *     The computation can be simplified by subtracting dh*qhat from
 *     both sides, suitably shifted.  This reduces the left side to
 *     dl*qhat.  On the right, (nh,nm)-dh*qhat is simply the
 *     remainder r from (nh,nm)%dh, so the right is (r,nl).
 *     This produces qhat that is almost always correct and at
 *     most (prob ~ 2/2^64) one too high.
 * - Subtract qhat times the divisor (suitably shifted) from the dividend.
 *   If there is a borrow, qhat was wrong, so decrement it
 *   and add the divisor back in (once).
 * - Store the final quotient digit qhat in the quotient array q.
 *
 * Repeat the quotient digit computation for successive digits of the
 * quotient until the whole quotient has been computed.  Then shift the
 * divisor and the remainder down to correct for the normalization.

/*
 * Montgomery reduce n, modulo mod.  This reduces modulo mod and divides by
 * 2^(64*mlen).  Returns the result in the *top* mlen words of the argument n.
 * This is ready for another multiplication using lbnMul_64.
 *
 * Montgomery representation is a very useful way to encode numbers when
 * you're doing lots of modular reduction.  What you do is pick a multiplier
 * R which is relatively prime to the modulus and very easy to divide by.
 * Since the modulus is odd, R is closen as a power of 2, so the division
 * is a shift.  In fact, it's a shift of an integral number of words,
 * so the shift can be implicit - just drop the low-order words.
 *
 * Now, choose R *larger* than the modulus m, 2^(64*mlen).  Then convert
 * all numbers a, b, etc. to Montgomery form M(a), M(b), etc using the
 * relationship M(a) = a*R mod m, M(b) = b*R mod m, etc.  Note that:
 * - The Montgomery form of a number depends on the modulus m.
 *   A fixed modulus m is assumed throughout this discussion.
 * - Since R is relaitvely prime to m, multiplication by R is invertible;
 *   no information about the numbers is lost, they're just scrambled.
 * - Adding (and subtracting) numbers in this form works just as usual.
 *   M(a+b) = (a+b)*R mod m = (a*R + b*R) mod m = (M(a) + M(b)) mod m
 * - Multiplying numbers in this form produces a*b*R*R.  The problem
 *   is to divide out the excess factor of R, modulo m as well as to
 *   reduce to the given length mlen.  It turns out that this can be
 *   done *faster* than a normal divide, which is where the speedup
 *   in Montgomery division comes from.
 *
 * Normal reduction chooses a most-significant quotient digit q and then
 * subtracts q*m from the number to be reduced.  Choosing q is tricky
 * and involved (just look at lbnDiv_64 to see!) and is usually
 * imperfect, requiring a check for correction after the subtraction.
 *
 * Montgomery reduction *adds* a multiple of m to the *low-order* part
 * of the number to be reduced.  This multiple is chosen to make the
 * low-order part of the number come out to zero.  This can be done
 * with no trickery or error using a precomputed inverse of the modulus.
 * In this code, the "part" is one word, but any width can be used.
 *
 * Repeating this step sufficiently often results in a value which
 * is a multiple of R (a power of two, remember) but is still (since
 * the additions were to the low-order part and thus did not increase
 * the value of the number being reduced very much) still not much
 * larger than m*R.  Then implicitly divide by R and subtract off
 * m until the result is in the correct range.
 *
 * Since the low-order part being cancelled is less than R, the
 * multiple of m added must have a multiplier which is at most R-1.
 * Assuming that the input is at most m*R-1, the final number is
 * at most m*(2*R-1)-1 = 2*m*R - m - 1, so subtracting m once from
 * the high-order part, equivalent to subtracting m*R from the
 * while number, produces a result which is at most m*R - m - 1,
 * which divided by R is at most m-1.

 * The windowed exponentiation algorithm, precomputes a table of odd

 *
 * It takes 2^(k-1)-1 multiplies to compute the table, and (e-1)/(k+1)
 * multiplies (on average) to perform the exponentiation.  To minimize
 * the sum, k must vary with e.  The optimal window sizes vary with the
 * exponent length.  Here are some selected values and the boundary cases.
 * (An underscore _ has been inserted into some of the numbers to ensure
 * that magic strings like 64 do not appear in this table.  It should be
 * ignored.)
 *
 * At e =    1 bits, k=1   (0.000000) is best
 * At e =    2 bits, k=1   (0.500000) is best

 *
 * The numbers in parentheses are the expected number of multiplications
 * needed to do the computation.  The normal russian-peasant modular
 * exponentiation technique always uses (e-1)/2.  For exponents as
 * small as 192 bits (below the range of current factoring algorithms),
 * half of the multiplies are eliminated, 45.2 as opposed to the naive
 * 95.5.  Counting the 191 squarings as 3/4 a multiply each (squaring
 * proper is just over half of multiplying, but the Montgomery
 * reduction in each case is also a multiply), that's 143.25
 * multiplies, for totals of 188.45 vs. 238.75 - a 21% savings.
 * For larger exponents (like 512 bits), it's 483.92 vs. 639.25, a
 * 24.3% savings.  It asymptotically approaches 25%.
 *
 * Um, actually there's a slightly more accurate way to count, which
 * really is the average number of multiplies required, averaged
 * uniformly over all 2^(e-1) e-bit numbers, from 2^(e-1) to (2^e)-1.
 * It's based on the recurrence that for the last b bits, b <= k, at
 * most one multiply is needed (and none at all 1/2^b of the time),
 * while when b > k, the odds are 1/2 each way that the bit will be
 * 0 (meaning no multiplies to reduce it to the b-1-bit case) and
 * 1/2 that the bit will be 1, starting a k-bit window and requiring
 * 1 multiply beyond the b-k-bit case.  Since the most significant
 * bit is always 1, a k-bit window always starts there, and that
 * multiply is by 1, so it isn't a multiply at all.  Thus, the
 * number of multiplies is simply that needed for the last e-k bits.
 * This recurrence produces:
 *
 * At e =    1 bits, k=1   (0.000000) is best

 * At e =  6_4 bits, k=3  (18.437500) is best
 * At e =   81 bits, k=4  (22.6_40000) < k=3  (22.687500)
 * At e =  128 bits, k=4 (3_2.040000) is best
 * At e =  241 bits, k=5  (54.611111) < k=4  (54.6_40000)
 * At e =  256 bits, k=5  (57.111111) is best
 * At e =  512 bits, k=5  (99.777778) is best
 * At e =  673 bits, k=6 (126.591837) < k=5 (126.611111)

 * At e = 2048 bits, k=7 (318.453125) is best
 * At e = 4096 bits, k=7 (574.453125) is best
 *
 * This has the rollover points at 6, 24, 81, 241, 673 and 1793 instead
 * of 8, 26, 82, 242, 674, and 1794.  Not a very big difference.
 * (The numbers past that are k=8 at 4609 and k=9 at 11521,
 * vs. one more in each case for the approximation.)
 *
 * Given that exponents for which k>7 are useful are uncommon,
 * a fixed size table for k <= 7 is used for simplicity.
 *
 * The basic number of squarings needed is e-1, although a k-bit
 * window (for k > 1) can save, on average, k-2 of those, too.
 * That savings currently isn't counted here.  It would drive the
 * crossover points slightly lower.
 * (Actually, this win is also reduced in the DoubleExpMod case,
 * meaning we'd have to split the tables.  Except for that, the
 * multiplies by powers of the two bases are independent, so
 * the same logic applies to each as the single case.)
 *
 * Table entry i is the largest number of bits in an exponent to
 * process with a window size of i+1.  Entry 6 is the largest
 * possible unsigned number, so the window will never be more
 * than 7 bits, requiring 2^6 = 0x40 slots.

 * Perform modular exponentiation, as fast as possible!  This uses
 * Montgomery reduction, optimized squaring, and windowed exponentiation.
 * The modulus "mod" MUST be odd!
 *
 * This returns 0 on success, -1 on out of memory.
 *
 * The window algorithm:
 * The idea is to keep a running product of b1 = n^(high-order bits of exp),
 * and then keep appending exponent bits to it.  The following patterns
 * apply to a 3-bit window (k = 3):
 * To append   0: square
 * To append   1: square, multiply by n^1
 * To append  10: square, multiply by n^1, square
 * To append  11: square, square, multiply by n^3
 * To append 100: square, multiply by n^1, square, square
 * To append 101: square, square, square, multiply by n^5
 * To append 110: square, square, multiply by n^3, square
 * To append 111: square, square, square, multiply by n^7
 *
 * Since each pattern involves only one multiply, the longer the pattern
 * the better, except that a 0 (no multiplies) can be appended directly.
 * We precompute a table of odd powers of n, up to 2^k, and can then
 * multiply k bits of exponent at a time.  Actually, assuming random
 * exponents, there is on average one zero bit between needs to
 * multiply (1/2 of the time there's none, 1/4 of the time there's 1,
 * 1/8 of the time, there's 2, 1/64 of the time, there's 3, etc.), so
 * you have to do one multiply per k+1 bits of exponent.
 *
 * The loop walks down the exponent, squaring the result buffer as
 * it goes.  There is a wbits+1 bit lookahead buffer, buf, that is
 * filled with the upcoming exponent bits.  (What is read after the
 * end of the exponent is unimportant, but it is filled with zero here.)
 * When the most-significant bit of this buffer becomes set, i.e.
 * (buf & tblmask) != 0, we have to decide what pattern to multiply
 * by, and when to do it.  We decide, remember to do it in future
 * after a suitable number of squarings have passed (e.g. a pattern
 * of "100" in the buffer requires that we multiply by n^1 immediately;
 * a pattern of "110" calls for multiplying by n^3 after one more
 * squaring), clear the buffer, and continue.
 *
 * When we start, there is one more optimization: the result buffer
 * is implcitly one, so squaring it or multiplying by it can be
 * optimized away.  Further, if we start with a pattern like "100"
 * in the lookahead window, rather than placing n into the buffer
 * and then starting to square it, we have already computed n^2
 * to compute the odd-powers table, so we can place that into
 * the buffer and save a squaring.
 *
 * This means that if you have a k-bit window, to compute n^z,
 * where z is the high k bits of the exponent, 1/2 of the time
 * it requires no squarings.  1/4 of the time, it requires 1
 * squaring, ... 1/2^(k-1) of the time, it reqires k-2 squarings.
 * And the remaining 1/2^(k-1) of the time, the top k bits are a
 * 1 followed by k-1 0 bits, so it again only requires k-2
 * squarings, not k-1.  The average of these is 1.  Add that
 * to the one squaring we have to do to compute the table,
 * and you'll see that a k-bit window saves k-2 squarings
 * as well as reducing the multiplies.  (It actually doesn't
 * hurt in the case k = 1, either.)
 *
 * n must have mlen words allocated.  Although fewer may be in use
 * when n is passed in, all are in use on exit.

 * n1^(e1>>e1bits) * n2^(e2>>e1bits) mod "mod".
 * As e1bits is counted down, this is updated, by squaring it and doing
 * any necessary multiplies.
 * To decide on the necessary multiplies, two windows, each w1bits+1 bits
 * wide, are maintained in buf1 and buf2, which read *ahead* of the
 * e1bits position (with appropriate handling of the case when e1bits
 * drops below w1bits+1).  When the most-significant bit of either window
 * becomes set, indicating that something needs to be multiplied by
 * the accumulator or it will get out of sync, the window is examined
 * to see which power of n1 or n2 to multiply by, and when (possibly
 * later, if the power is greater than 1) the multiply should take
 * place.  Then the multiply and its location are remembered and the
 * window is cleared.
 *
 * If we had every power of n1 in the table, the multiply would always
 * be w1bits steps in the future.  But we only keep the odd powers,
 * so instead of waiting w1bits squarings and then multiplying
 * by n1^k, we wait w1bits-k squarings and multiply by n1.
 *
 * Actually, w2bits can be less than w1bits, but the window is the same
 * size, to make it easier to keep track of where we're reading.  The
 * appropriate number of low-order bits of the window are just ignored.

 * arrays of pointers to procomputed powers of the corresponding bases,
 * each 2^bits apart.  (I.e. array1[i] is base1^(2^(i*bits))).
 * 
 * Bits must be the same in both.  (It could be made adjustable, but it's
 * a bit of a pain.  Just make them both equal to the larger one.)
 * 
 * The algorithm consists of:
 * a  = b  = (powers of base1 and base2  to be raised to the power 2^bits-1)
 * a *= b *= (powers of base1 and base2 to be raised to the power 2^bits-2)
 * ...
 * a *= b *= (powers of base1 and base2 to be raised to the power 1)
 * 
 * All we do is walk the exponent 2^bits-1 times in groups of "bits" bits,
